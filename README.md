APPWORLD WEBSITE

The AppWorld website designed as a platform where users can get information about Android and Apple app, read reviews on a vast range of smartphones, and gear. 
The website consists of 4 pages, including, the Home page, Apps page, Reviews page, and Gear page. The design flow idea of all the pages is similar except for the landing page in this case which is the home page. 

THE HOME PAGE

The Home page is named as index.html in the backend design. There are 4 section in this html file namely; the Navigation menu, the trending section, the reviews section and the footer. 

The Navigation menu just like like any other website will help you navigate the entire website and the code for this is the same across all other pages. 
In the Navigation menu is the website logo together with the links. The logo is to the far left whereas the links are to the far right. 
To achieve the design in the front end as seen, I added some css properties as indicated in the css styling file named index.css.

The trending apps section is a sneak look and the most recent posts by authors on the website. To achieve the design as seen in the website front end, I used the help of css Flexbox. 
The look fo the Trending section is different on two different media screens. To achieve this, I used the help of css media queries where screen sizes below 576 pixels will display differently from those above 576 pixels. This applies to font size and the aligning of pictures in this section.

The Reviews section is also a sneak look at recent smartphone reviews. Each phone review will indicate whether it is an Android or Apple device, a title, and a small paragragh describing the review. This will display in device screens above 576 pixels and for small screens, a media query display: none; will not display the paragragh to avoid over crowded content in the smaller screen devices.

The Footer section is the part of the website where that will show a simple About Us, users can also navigate the website here, social media links, and also access to the contact us page.

THE APPS, REVIEW, and GEAR PAGES

These pages follow the same design dynamics as Home page only that they are targeted to a particular topic at their names state. 

THE CONTACT US PAGE

This is a page in the website entiles a more detailed about us of the website plus also has the leave us a message form.

All the pages shown in the navigation links are a sneak look at the different sections of the website. For a user to get a full detailed discription of a particular app, smartphone, or gear, they should click the picture of that particular article which is a link to that particular review.
